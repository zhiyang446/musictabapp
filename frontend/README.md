## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Frontend not loading:**

- Check CORS settings in the API server
- Verify network connectivity

**File upload not working:**
- Check file format and size limits
- Ensure user account is created
- Verify backend upload endpoint is accessible

**Styles not loading:**
- Check if styles.css is accessible
